# CREDIT-LOAN-DEFAULTER
Managing the credit risk by using the past data and deciding whom to give the loan to in the future



-Statistical Analysis

-Checking the Missing Values

-Checking the Unique Values in the dataset

-Feature Selection Techniques : Removed the Irrelevant features from the dataset, Determining the feature importance from mutual_info_classif, Used the SelectKBest

-Missing data Imputation : Imputed the missing value of categorical variable with the mode and numerical variable with mean/zeroes

-Visualizing the Missing data : Visualising the missing values in each column after dropping the variables

-Defining the values of features : Mapping the variables into classes 

-Converting Categorical to Numerical : Used Label Encoding to encode the categorical variable with numeric value

-Train and test Split: Splitting data into Xtrain,Xtest,Ytrain,Ytest

-Feature Scaling : Data Standardization using StandardScaler

-Handling Imbalance dataset : performed oversampling using SMOTE, Resampling technique

-Applied Machine Learning Algorithms : Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, ExtraTreesClassifier Adaboost Classifier, Gradient Boosting, XG Boost,   VotingClassifier

-Tuning the model : Adjusting the threshold level for probabilities

-Applied Deep Learning Algorithm : Trained the data using ANN Technique - MLPClassifier from Neural Network

-Test Prediction : Predicting the Test Result set on the basis of Confusion Matrix, Accuracy Score, Classification Report
